"Audit-ready technical presence from Hungary"

### About me

I build reproducible, audit-ready infrastructure — Debian-native, PostgreSQL-based, open security by design.  
My work reflects technical clarity, autonomy, and auditability.  
I do not list services. I define interfaces.

### Reach out if…

- You need infrastructure audits, authentication reform, or SQL-based access logic  
- You work with real systems and value reproducibility over platform noise  
- You understand open security architecture and package-level audit

This interface is not optimized for vague outreach or role-based expectations.  
Technical presence only.
